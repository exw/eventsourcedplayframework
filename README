This is an older, unfinished 2013 project that explores an event-sourced architecture as articulated by [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html), implemented in Play Framework in Scala and Redis.

Future plans include: 

(1) improving the UX

(2) implementing a system of composable modular components based on Facebook's BigPipe as explained by [Yevginiy Brikman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b1XLka0UIw), particularly something that hooks into my pinboard API

(3) adding functionality for granular privacy controls for who can see blog posts and comments


Forked from Eric Zilverline's example blog application using event sourcing, memory image, and Play! 2.1 with Scala
